# EDMD
## Event Driven Molecular Dynamics with Python

This is a Pythonic version of the JavaScript EDMD code that I wrote for the [Visual Chemical Engineering (VCE) project](http://visualchemeng.com/). 

The JavaScript version is hosted on GitHub [here](https://github.com/adm78/visualchemeng_js/blob/master/modules/md/md.js).
